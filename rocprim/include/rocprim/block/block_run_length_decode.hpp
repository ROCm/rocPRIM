/**
 * \brief The block_run_length_decode class supports decoding a run-length encoded array of items. That is, given
 * the two arrays run_value[N] and run_lengths[N], run_value[i] is repeated run_lengths[i] many times in the output
 * array.
 * Due to the nature of the run-length decoding algorithm ("decompression"), the output size of the run-length decoded
 * array is runtime-dependent and potentially without any upper bound. To address this, block_run_length_decode allows
 * retrieving a "window" from the run-length decoded array. The window's offset can be specified and BLOCK_THREADS *
 * DECODED_ITEMS_PER_THREAD (i.e., referred to as window_size) decoded items from the specified window will be returned.
 *
 * \note: Trailing runs of length 0 are supported (i.e., they may only appear at the end of the run_lengths array).
 * A run of length zero may not be followed by a run length that is not zero.
