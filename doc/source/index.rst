The ``rocPRIM`` is a header-only library providing HIP parallel primitives to ease the maintainability of performant and yet portable GPU-accelerated code on AMD ROCm platform.

As it is the ROCM dual of Nvidia CUB ( https://github.com/NVIDIA/cub ), looking at the CUB documentation could be also interesting for you: https://nvlabs.github.io/cub/index.html
