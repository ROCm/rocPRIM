 rocPRIM documentation
********************************************************************

rocPRIM is a header-only library that provides HIP parallel primitives. The purpose of the library is to ease the maintainability of performant, yet portable GPU-accelerated code on the AMD ROCm platform. rocPRIM is written in HIP and has been optimized for AMD's latest discrete GPUs. For more information refer to :ref:`rocprim-intro`.

The code is open and hosted at: https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rocPRIM
